# Overview

TKD Belt Study is a practical tool which helps in the required memorization of Taekwondo form names and meanings for testing.
TKD Belt Study allows users to view a list of Taekwondo Belts.
When the user taps on any one of the belts, they are taken to a second page.
The second page shows the belt information, including the name and meaning associated with that belt.
Here the user has the opportunity to read and memorize the names and meanings, 
then choose a study level of either Easy, Medium, or Hard.
With each level, the amount of words in the meaning become hidden to the user, until all words can be hidden.
This is to allow the user to practice memorization of each name and meaning for Rank Testing.

My purpose for creating this project was to strengthen my mobile development skills.
Additionally, I wanted to learn how to structure a Flutter project and familiarize myself with Dart.
